# 📊 CIT5900 Final Project: FSRDC Research Output

This project consolidates research outputs from all student groups to build a unified dataset related to the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs). Our team cleaned, enriched, and visualized the combined dataset using Python, and presented the key insights through a live dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🧠 What We Did
- **Data Integration & Enrichment:** Merged and deduplicated 8 group datasets; added missing metadata fields.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identified top authors, output types, and RDCs using customized filtering and visual tools.
- **Modeling:** Applied clustering, PCA, and regression to explore deeper patterns.
- **Presentation:** Built an interactive dashboard site to communicate our findings visually and clearly.
